# Azure Cloud Resume Challenge

# Overview:

This project involves the integration of GitHub, Azure DevOps, and Terraform to manage and automate the deployment of Azure Functions and Azure Storage Containers. It aims to streamline the development process, enforce good version control practices, and automate infrastructure management.
Technologies Used

- GitHub: For version control and storing the project's codebase, including Terraform configuration files.
- Azure DevOps: Used for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, project management, and version control.
- Terraform: An Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool used to define, provision, and manage Azure cloud infrastructure.
